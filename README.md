# Classification---Flipkart-Customer-Service-Satisfaction
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts customer satisfaction scores based on customer support remarks using natural language processing (NLP) and classification models. It is designed to help businesses identify dissatisfaction early and improve service quality.

📌 Problem Statement
Predict the Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) based on user remarks left during or after a customer support interaction. The goal is to convert qualitative feedback into quantitative insights using supervised machine learning and NLP techniques.

🔍 Project Overview
Input: Customer remarks (text)

Output: Predicted CSAT score (ranging from 2 to 5)

Approach: NLP preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Evaluation → Deployment

Deployment: A simple Flask API that accepts input features and returns predictions.
